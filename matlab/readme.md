# Usage

There are two ways of using the trajectory generator: `main_optimt.m` and `main.m`.

## Trajectory generation with time reallocation optimization
To use this version use `main_optimt.m` and setup the waypoints using setupProblem.m

## Trajectory generation without time reallocation optimization
If you don't want to optimize segment times you can use `main.m`. This file has
nicer plotting code.
